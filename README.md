# RFID-Cards
Abstract:
Radio frequency identification (RFID) devices are an essential part of almost 
all physical security systems. RFID cards and card readers are used to restrict 
access to buildings or rooms. In this context, the RFID card stores a unique 
identification number that is wirelessly detected by a RFID card reader 
attached to a wall. If the RFID cardâ€™s identification number matches an 
identification number from a stored list of authorized cards, the door is 
unlocked and the cardholder can enter the room. RFID devices operate at 
high-frequency from 3MHz to 30MHz. But most RFID devices usually operate 
at 13.56MHz.
